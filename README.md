## 📜 Game Rules

### Objective
Get a hand value as close to **21** as possible without going over (busting), while beating the dealer's hand.

### Card Values
| Card | Value |
|------|-------|
| 2-10 | Face value |
| J, Q, K | 10 |
| Ace | 11 (or 1 if hand would bust) |

### Winning Conditions
- **Blackjack**: Getting exactly 21 with your first two cards (Ace + 10-value card)
- **Beat the Dealer**: Have a higher hand value than the dealer without busting
- **Dealer Busts**: Dealer's hand exceeds 21

### Dealer Rules
- Dealer must hit on 16 or less
- Dealer must stand on 17 or more

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Enter the number of games you want to play
2. You'll receive two cards (both visible)
3. Dealer receives two cards (one hidden)
4. Choose your action:
   - **Hit (H)**: Take another card
   - **Stand (S)**: Keep your current hand
5. Try to get as close to 21 without going over
6. Dealer reveals their hand and plays
7. Winner is determined!
